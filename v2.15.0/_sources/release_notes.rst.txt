 Release History
=================

v2.15.0 (2023-04-04)
====================

Python 3.9 is now the minimum supported version for pytmc.

Maintenance
-----------
* Fixes pre-commit repository settings for flake8.
* Migrates from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for continuous integration testing, and documentation deployment.
* Updates pytmc to use setuptools-scm, replacing versioneer, as its version-string management tool of choice.
* Syntax has been updated to Python 3.9+ via ``pyupgrade``.
* pytmc has migrated to modern ``pyproject.toml``, replacing ``setup.py``.
* Sphinx 6.0 now supported for documentation building.
* ``docs-versions-menu`` is now used for documentation deployment on GitHub Actions.


v2.14.1 (2022-09-28)
====================

This release doesn't change any behavior of the library, but it does fix an error in the test suite that causes false failures.

Maintenance
-----------

* TST: test suite was using old kwarg, swap to new by @ZLLentz in #296


v2.14.0 (2022-08-29)
====================

Fixes
-----
* Safety PLC files loaded from `_Config/SPLC` by @klauer in https://github.com/pcdshub/pytmc/pull/289

Enhancements
------------

* Sort generated records by TwinCAT symbol name (tcname) by @klauer in https://github.com/pcdshub/pytmc/pull/293
    * The order of records in EPICS process database (`.db`) files will change for most users after this release. After the initial rebuild, users should expect to see smaller diffs on subsequent PLC project rebuilds.
* Add all hooks required to allow transition of pytmc stcmd -> template by @klauer in https://github.com/pcdshub/pytmc/pull/290
  * Adds helper commands to `pytmc template`, which can be used in Jinja templates:
      * `generate_records` (create .db and .archive files)
      * `get_plc_by_name`
      * `get_symbols_by_type`
  * Adds variables to `pytmc template` environment, which can be used in Jinja templates:
     * `pytmc_version`
  * Adds `--macro` option to `pytmc template`
  * Fixes some annotations + uncovered/untested functionality
  * Allows `pytmc template` to read/write multiple templates with parsing a project only once


v2.13.0 (2022-06-30)
====================

Enhancements
------------
* ENH: autosave field additions by @klauer in https://github.com/pcdshub/pytmc/pull/287

    * Adds alarm severity and limit fields to autosave for all relevant input and output records
    * Adds control limit (drive low/high) fields to autosave for relevant output records

v2.12.0 (2022-05-27)
====================

Fixes
-----
* CP link instead of CPP link by @klauer in https://github.com/pcdshub/pytmc/pull/283

Maintenance
-----------
* Address CI-related failures and update pre-commit settings by @klauer in https://github.com/pcdshub/pytmc/pull/285


v2.11.1 (2022-03-24)
====================

Maintenance
-----------

* CLN: remove evalcontextfilter usage by @klauer in #280
   * Jinja2 3.1 compatibility fix
* TST: does linking work as expected? by @klauer in #279
   * Additional tests

v2.11.0 (2021-11-15)
====================

Enhancements
------------
* Add ``EnumerationTextList`` with ``get_source_code`` support.
  Previously, these translatable types were missing.
* Add actions, methods, and properties to the ``pytmc code`` output.
* Allow for ``pytmc code`` to work with just a single code object,
  rather than requiring the whole project.
* Add ``pytmc.__main__`` such that
  ``python -m pytmc {code,summary} ...`` works.

Fixes
-----
* Fix rare bug in `lines_between` function, probably never hit.

Maintenance
-----------
* Type annotation cleanups and fixes
* Reduce memory consumption slightly by not caching the xml element
  on every `TwincatItem`


v2.10.0 (2021-08-09)
====================

Enhancements
------------
* Allow strings to be linked using the ``link:`` pragma key. Previously,
  this was only implemented for numeric scalar values.


v2.9.1 (2021-04-27)
===================

Enhancements
------------
* Added ``scale`` and ``offset`` pragma keys for integer and floating point
  symbols.

Maintenance
-----------
* Fixed remaining ``slaclab`` references, after the repository was moved to
  ``pcdshub``.


v2.9.0 (2021-04-02)
===================

Enhancements
------------
* Add git information to the template tool if available.


v2.8.1 (2021-02-10)
===================

Fixes
-----
* Fix issues related to insufficient library dependency checking. Now,
  all possible places where library version information is stored will
  be checked.

Maintenance
-----------
* Refactor the dependency-related twincat items and templating tools
  to accomplish the above.
* Move the repository landing zone from slaclab to pcdshub to take
  advantage of our travis credits.
* Redeploy doctr for pcdshub.


v2.8.0 (2020-12-22)
===================

Enhancements
------------

* Add support for externally adding pragmas to members of structures and
  function blocks.
* Add support for partial pragmas of array elements.
* Added text filter in ``pytmc debug`` dialog.
* Check maximum record length when generating the database file.  This is a
  constant defined at epics-base compile time, defaulting to 60.

Fixes
-----

* Record names now displaying correctly in ``pytmc debug`` dialog.
* ``pytmc debug`` no longer fails when it encounters types that extend
  built-in data types by way of ``ExtendsType``.


v2.7.7 (2020-11-17)
===================

Fixes
-----
* Fix issue with pass1 autosave not appropriately writing values to the PLC
  on IOC startup.

Maintenance
-----------
* Regenerate doctr deploy key.


v2.7.6 (2020-10-23)
===================

Fixes
-----
* Added handling for case where pragma is None
* Lower array archive threshold to arrays with fewer than 1000 elements
  to prevent our high-rate encoder and power meter readbacks. This is a good
  threshold because it represents 1000Hz data with a 1Hz polling rate, a
  very typical parameter.
* Default APST and MPST fields to "On Change" for waveform PVs. These are
  special waveform fields that tell monitors and the archiver when to take an
  update, and previously they were set to "Always", causing influxes of data
  from static char waveform strings.

Maintenance
-----------
* Split dev/docs requirements
* Fix jinja naming


v2.7.5 (2020-08-31)
===================

Fixes
-----

* Relaxed end-of-pragma-line handling (any combination of ``;`` and newline are
  all accepted).
* Reworked XTI file loading for "devices" and "boxes".  This aims to be more
  compatible with TwinCAT, which does not always relocate XTI files to be in
  the correct hierarchical directory location.  It pre-loads all XTI files, and
  when the project is fully loaded, it dereferences XTI files based on a key
  including ``class``, ``filename``, and a small PLC-unique ``identifier``.
* Better handling of data types in the project parser. Now supports data type
  GUIDs, when available, for data type disambiguation.  Note that these are not
  always present.
* Better handling of references, pointers, and pointer depth.

Development
-----------

* ``pytmc db --debug`` allows developers to more easily target exceptions
  raised when generating database files.
* Added more memory layout information for the benefit of other utilities such
  as ``ads-async``. Its ADS server implementation in conjunction with pytmc may
  be a good source of information regarding PLC memory layout in the future.
* Started adding some annotations for clarity.  May retroactively add more as
  time permits.


v2.7.1 (2020-08-18)
===================

Fixes
-----

* Working fix for macro expansion character replacement for linked PVs
  (``DOL`` field).  This means ``link: @(MACRO)PV`` now works.
* Tests will no longer be installed erroneously as a package on the system.

Development
-----------

* Tests have been moved into the pytmc package, and with it flake8 compliance.


v2.7.0 (2020-07-16)
===================

  linked PVs (``DOL`` field)
