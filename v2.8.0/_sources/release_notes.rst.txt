 Release History
=================

v2.8.0 (2020-??-??)
===================

Enhancements
------------

* Add support for externally adding pragmas to members of structures and
  function blocks.
* Add support for partial pragmas of array elements.
* Added text filter in ``pytmc debug`` dialog.
* Check maximum record length when generating the database file.  This is a
  constant defined at epics-base compile time, defaulting to 60.

Fixes
-----

* Record names now displaying correctly in ``pytmc debug`` dialog.
* ``pytmc debug`` no longer fails when it encounters types that extend
  built-in data types by way of ``ExtendsType``.

v2.7.7 (2020-11-17)
===================

Fixes
-----
* Fix issue with pass1 autosave not appropriately writing values to the PLC
  on IOC startup.

Maintenance
-----------
* Regenerate doctr deploy key.


v2.7.6 (2020-10-23)
===================

Fixes
-----
* Added handling for case where pragma is None
* Lower array archive threshold to arrays with fewer than 1000 elements
  to prevent our high-rate encoder and power meter readbacks. This is a good
  threshold because it represents 1000Hz data with a 1Hz polling rate, a
  very typical parameter.
* Default APST and MPST fields to "On Change" for waveform PVs. These are
  special waveform fields that tell monitors and the archiver when to take an
  update, and previously they were set to "Always", causing influxes of data
  from static char waveform strings.

Maintenance
-----------
* Split dev/docs requirements
* Fix jinja naming


v2.7.5 (2020-08-31)
===================

Fixes
-----

* Relaxed end-of-pragma-line handling (any combination of ``;`` and newline are
  all accepted).
* Reworked XTI file loading for "devices" and "boxes".  This aims to be more
  compatible with TwinCAT, which does not always relocate XTI files to be in
  the correct hierarchical directory location.  It pre-loads all XTI files, and
  when the project is fully loaded, it dereferences XTI files based on a key
  including ``class``, ``filename``, and a small PLC-unique ``identifier``.
* Better handling of data types in the project parser. Now supports data type
  GUIDs, when available, for data type disambiguation.  Note that these are not
  always present.
* Better handling of references, pointers, and pointer depth.

Development
-----------

* ``pytmc db --debug`` allows developers to more easily target exceptions
  raised when generating database files.
* Added more memory layout information for the benefit of other utilities such
  as ``ads-async``. Its ADS server implementation in conjunction with pytmc may
  be a good source of information regarding PLC memory layout in the future.
* Started adding some annotations for clarity.  May retroactively add more as
  time permits.


v2.7.1 (2020-08-18)
===================

Fixes
-----

* Working fix for macro expansion character replacement for linked PVs
  (``DOL`` field).  This means ``link: @(MACRO)PV`` now works.
* Tests will no longer be installed erroneously as a package on the system.

Development
-----------

* Tests have been moved into the pytmc package, and with it flake8 compliance.
