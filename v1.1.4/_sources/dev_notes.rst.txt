Developer's Notes
=================
A page for storing information and announcements concerning the development of
Pytpy

Concerning ADS Driver upgrades (3/8/18)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Newer iterations of ESS's ADS Driver no longer use the .proto file and can
offer better performance for the IOC. While the driver's backwards
compatibility should still work with pytmc's current output, upgrading pytmc to
use the new format has been added as a priority.

PYTPY is now PYTMC (1/25/18)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The name of the package has been updated to reflect the change in target file.

TPY vs. TMC (1/16/18)
+++++++++++++++++++++
Pytpy no longer uses the .tpy files generated by TwinCAT. As of at least
TwinCAT v3.1.4020 These .tpy files are deprecated and lack important
information such as pragmas. The .tmc files now fulfill this role and contain
the necessary information.
