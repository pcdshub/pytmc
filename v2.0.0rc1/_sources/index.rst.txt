Pytmc helps developers automatically generate ADS based Epics records files
from Beckhoff's TwinCAT3 projects.

Pytmc is developed with these `guidelines
<https://pcdshub.github.io/development.html>`_ in mind.

The source code is hosted on `github <https://github.com/slaclab/pytmc>`_.

Issues and requests can be posted on the `github issue tracker
<https://github.com/slaclab/pytmc/issues>`_. Use the ``bug`` tag for issues
with intended features and the ``enhancement`` tag can be used for feature
requests. The ``question`` tag will be treated like an 'enhancements' tag for
the documentation but regular questions can be posted there as well.
